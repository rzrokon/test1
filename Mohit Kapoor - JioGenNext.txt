The startup community in India will play a big role in achieving Digital India objective.  

00:00:09 1
We at Jio come across a whole lot of startups and they're building some really valuable and really 
cool work.  

00:00:17 1
You know, Gennext Hub, we need to thank because that's a platform for us to interact with these 
cool startups.  

00:00:24 1
We want to work with them on an immediate basis.  

00:00:27 1
We want to work with them on a near-term basis.  

00:00:30 1
They, these startups actually bring a lot of value to Jio.  

00:00:34 1
So, once again, GenXtub, keep sending all the startups, keep bringing on board all the cool 
startups and we would love to mentor the founders.  

00:00:47 1
We would be very happy to be the launch platform for these startups and so GenXtub, once again, 
keep on doing the great job which you guys are doing.
